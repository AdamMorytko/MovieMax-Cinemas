# MovieMax-Cinemas
An application to book tickets for a movie in a cinema.
# Already done:
- An interesting feature to fill database with movies from Filmweb without using API (because it is not public). I used jsoup to manipulate DOM tree and retrieve movie title, director, URL for a poster etc.
- Admin page to manage cinemas, movies, screenings.
- Main page to book tickets
- Some validation
- The application is not yet foolproof
# To be done:
- Spring Security for different roles (super admin (managing all cinemas, granting admins), admins (managing their own cinemas), users, visitors), login, registration etc.
- Validation needs polishing
- Extras like history of purchases etc.
# Used technologies:
- Java
- Html
- Css
- Thymeleaf
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- Security (to be used)
- MySQL
- Maven
- Bootstrap
